NEXT BRANCHINH:::
        normally in a folder there exits only one branch named MAIN 
        to show all branches present is """ git branch -a """
        to create new branch in github is clicking main branch and name the side branch..
        if you want same files as in main then click that something option that occurs..

        this can be viewed in system (vs code) only when the comment uses git pull to update the system.

        default ah you will be in the main branch , to select the side branch(branch1)
        use """ git checkout branch1 """
