  STEPS ( INSERT - ADD - COMMIT - PUSH)

  step 1:
  you have to create a repositary in the github1
  after that you create a file named test1.txt 
  then to get that file in our system ( in vs code), 
  we create a folder for the repositary named GIT beginners..

  then we use terminal and type """ git clone <link of the folder through the code option
  at he top of the repositary and of course greater lesser sysmbols are not written> """



  once it is done we get a three stages  which one is a orginal gitfile in the repositary 
  and other is a git clone gile and other is a  clone working file.

  the changes or creating a new file in github1 through vs code doesnt affect the git file,
  we can verify this through """git status""" in the new file (text2.txt)....

  the procees is we take the second test2 to the git file and to the git hub...
  to make that use 
  """git add test2.txt """
   , now U(untracked) changed into A(added). which these are stored in the staging area. or also M(modified)

  staging area = stage between working file and the git file
  To sent it to git clone file we use 
  """git commit -m "commmit name" """
   now this adds them into the  git clone file

  after this we have crossed the second change, then next we have to take text2 to the main github file.
  FOR that we use 
  """git push origin main"""

  origin = the link we first pushed into the folder (github1) .we push the file wherever you want
            in the folder(github1) either in main or other branches..


  also since i have wrtten something here in test1 and not in the original github file (test1)
  it show M (modified) to change that also use git add <file name.txt>
