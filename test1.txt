  okay 

  STEPS ( INSERT - ADD - COMMIT - PUSH)
  THIS IS FOR PUSHING THE FILE IN OUR SYSTEM TO THE GITHUB 

  step 1:
  you have to create a repositary in the github1
  after that you create a file named test1.txt 
  then to get that file in our system ( in vs code), 
  we create a folder for the repositary named GIT beginners..

  then we use terminal and type """ git clone <link of the folder through the code option
  at he top of the repositary and of course greater lesser sysmbols are not written> """



  once it is done we get a three stages  which one is a orginal gitfile in the repositary 
  and other is a git clone gile and other is a  clone working file.

  the changes or creating a new file in github1 through vs code doesnt affect the git file,
  we can verify this through """git status""" in the new file (text2.txt)....

  the procees is we take the second test2 to the git file and to the git hub...
  to make that use 
  """git add test2.txt """
   , now U(untracked) changed into A(added). which these are stored in the staging area. or also M(modified)

  staging area = stage between working file and the git file
  To sent it to git clone file we use 
  """git commit -m "commmit name" """
   now this adds them into the  git clone file

  after this we have crossed the second change, then next we have to take text2 to the main github file.
  FOR that we use 
  """git push origin main"""

  origin = the link we first pushed into the folder (github1) .we push the file wherever you want
            in the folder(github1) either in main or other branches..


  also since i have wrtten something here in test1 and not in the original github file (test1)
  it show M (modified) to change that also use git add <file name.txt>

  step2:
    deleting the file which alreadt uploade  in the github(test3.txt)
    use the samed add (git add "filename") and take it the staging area
    then use commit (git commit -m "deleted test3.txt")
    then push the file (git push orgin main)


FILE ADD IN THE repositary IN GITHUB AND THE CHANGES NEEDS TO BE DONE IN OUR SYSTEM(VS CODE)
        we wont use git clone link as it only gives the new created file but we need whole.
        this is known as PULL
        (""" git pull""")
        by using this comment, add or modified any file in the repositary folder can also 
        be changed or added in our system(vs code) ...


LET US CREATE A NEW FOLDER IN THE SYSTEM VS CODE(GITHUB2), THEN HOW WILL WE TAKE IT TO THE GITHUB..
STEPS:
    since we are currently in the github1 directory(C:\git beginners\github1> )
    change it to github2 using cd..and cd <folder name>                         ( github2)


    now the given still wont show the hidden git if you open the folder in file manager..
    even if you use show hidden since its not connected to github

    TO change that first step would be :
        use """ git init """

        you might say for next step use """git add filename """ but this takes longer if many files present.
        hence, we use git add .  (. signifies all of files in folder)
        then use """"git commit m- "created index.html and style.css" """
        this makes the files in folder added in git clone..
        after before pushing them into github ,, we need to create a repositary (github2)

        NOW TO INSERT THE SYSTEM FOLDER INTO THAT REPOSITARY:
          push would be like
          """ git remote add origin https://github.com/Abishek77sist/github2.git (taken from the repositary)

          now if you use """git branch """..
          it will show master instead of main ,,this is becuase in older version we used master insteadof branch.
          hence if """we use git push origin main""" , it will throw error 

          now you either type """git push origin master"""
          else:
            change branch name using """git branch -M main
            next use """ git push origin main """
